# COMP 110 - Introduction to Programming and Data Science

Welcome to the repository for my coursework and projects from the "COMP 110" course. This course is designed to introduce students to programming and data science from a computational perspective, with a strong emphasis on modern applications and ethical considerations in computing.

## Course Overview

COMP 110 introduces foundational programming concepts and data science techniques through problem-solving and algorithm development. The course is structured to accommodate students with no prior programming experience, as well as those looking to strengthen their understanding of computational thinking.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Programming Fundamentals:**
  - Data types and variables
  - Sequences and Boolean logic
  - Control flow: conditionals and loops
  - Functions and methods
  - Classes and objects
  - Input/output operations

- **Data Science Techniques:**
  - Data organization and transformation
  - Basic data analysis and visualization
  - Algorithms for data processing
  - Introduction to problem decomposition and abstraction design

- **Computing in Society:**
  - Ethics in computing
  - Implications of data and technology on society
