MC= via Monte Carlo method. Gain is in cents vs 25.6836c,
which is the theoretical average for bet $5 vs. $3.77389,
which is the theoretical one.
Random[] in Mathematica is of of poor quality;
I improved it somewhat but MC Gain is still somewhat
below the theoretical average. If you use simple
Random[], then it will be mostly >26c.
